## About me
Hello All,

I'm Ajay. I create educational content in [TechPrimers](https://youtube.com/TechPrimers).
I started this channel on Feb 11, 2017 with the idea to Learn, Code and Share knowledge on the latest technology trends.

Since then I have learnt, written and shared lots of code in [Github](http://github.com/TechPrimers).
This repository/github page is dedicated to you all. If you have not contributed to Open Source before, then this is your chance to
contribute.

Fork this [repo](https://github.com/TechPrimers/techprimers.github.io) and raise a pull request to add a markdown file with your name and content in it (precisely an About me page), it will be displayed under our Github page
(`https://techprimers.github.io/contributors`).

Detailed steps can be found in the `README.md` [here](https://github.com/TechPrimers/techprimers.github.io/blob/master/README.md)

Happy Coding!
