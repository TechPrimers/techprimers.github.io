## About me
Hello All,

Myself Virendra Yadav,

I am Technical Architect and for past 14+ Years I am working on technologies. I am also Co-Founder of company www.bigperl.com, which builds web, mobile apps & IoT based solutions. 

I love keep myself updated with upcoming technologies and TechPrimers is one of the right channels I follow. 

Mostly I work on Java/Jee/Spring/Android Native/Swift/AWS based backend technologies.
