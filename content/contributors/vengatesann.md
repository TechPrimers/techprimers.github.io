## About me
Hi All,

I'm Vengatesan, a **full stack developer(SpringBoot, Microservices, DevOps & Angular)**. I have 2 years of experience on end to end application development and also *I'm more interested to do system architectural design*.

When I'm exploring new tools and technology , I learned by self interested and then do it from scratch. And If I'm doing some POC on particular technology or concepts,  [TechPrimers](https://youtube.com/TechPrimers) one of all other tech community helps me to understand it in different perspective view, **Thanks** for that.

This is the first time for me to contribute in open source. I think this platform will helps everyone to 
Feel the Power of Open Source...
