## About me
Hey there everyone,

I'm student in 2nd year CSE, having done Competitive programming during my first year. Enjoyed it, now i'm trying to learn open source. This is my first contribution quite excited about it.
Throughout i've learnt few languages like C, C++ and little hands on Python. Currently starting with Nodejs after learning JS. Made a game using JS it's called PIG GAME (i know >.<). Continuing with another project i hope it goes well too.
It is good to be here and being part of this community.

Thanks!!

You can see my project and reach me at:

Let's learn Open source ...CHEERS!!
