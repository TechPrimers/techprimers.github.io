## About me
Hello All,

I'm Muiz, a full stack developer(SpringBoot, Node.js, Angular, React, CI/CD).
To me, Youtube is one of the primary sources of exploring new tools and technologies.
I would rank [TechPrimers](https://youtube.com/TechPrimers) the highest among Indian Youtube contributors in Tech space.

I've been coding for 5 years now but this is my first contribution to a open source project. If you haven't contributed to open source before, do it!

Happy Coding!
