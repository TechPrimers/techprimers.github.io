I&rsquo;m student in 2nd year CSE, having done Competitive programming during my first year. Enjoyed it, now i&rsquo;m trying to learn open source. This is my first contribution quite excited about it. Throughout i&rsquo;ve learnt few languages like C, C&#43;&#43; and little hands on Python. Currently starting with Nodejs after learning JS. Made a game using JS it&rsquo;s called PIG GAME (i know &gt;.&lt;). Continuing with another project i hope it goes well too." />

<p>Hey there everyone,</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m student in 2nd year CSE, having done Competitive programming during my first year. Enjoyed it, now i&rsquo;m trying to learn open source. This is my first contribution quite excited about it.
Throughout i&rsquo;ve learnt few languages like C, C++ and little hands on Python. Currently starting with Nodejs after learning JS. Made a game using JS it&rsquo;s called PIG GAME (i know &gt;.&lt;). Continuing with another project i hope it goes well too.
It is good to be here and being part of this community.</p>
